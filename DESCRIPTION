Title: Adverse Event Enrichment Tests
Type: Package
Description: We extend existing gene enrichment tests to perform adverse 
    event enrichment analysis. Unlike the continuous gene expression data, 
    adverse event data are counts. Therefore, adverse event data has many zeros 
    and ties. We propose two enrichment tests. One is a modified Fisher's exact 
    test based on pre-selected significant adverse events, while the other is 
    based on a modified Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic.
