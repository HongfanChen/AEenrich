Title: Adverse Event Enrichment Tests
Type: Package
Description: We extend existing gene enrichment tests to perform adverse 
    event (AE) enrichment analysis. Unlike the continuous gene expression data, AE 
    data are counts. Therefore, AE data has many zeros and ties. We propose two 
    enrichment tests. One is a modified Fisher's exact test based on pre-selected 
    significant AEs, while the other is based on a modified Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
    statistic.
